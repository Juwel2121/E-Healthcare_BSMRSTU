## Abstract
The **E-Healthcare BSMRSTU** project aims to provide e-health services and information to the BSMRSTU community. In the face of misinformation, this project simplifies access to various health services and advice tailored to individual user needs. By following the provided instructions, users can enhance their health safety and access a wealth of information about available services, including contacting the corona control department.

## Introduction
The **E-Healthcare BSMRSTU** project functions as a comprehensive healthcare management system tailored for the BSMRSTU community. Administrators can easily manage medical reports and member information, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and updates. Each member of the community has a unique identity that facilitates personalized healthcare management.

This application is implemented using Java and MySQL within Apache NetBeans. It can also function as a blood bank by enabling users to share their blood group information and indicate their willingness to donate.
